# diverse_python_scripts
Just a collection of random python scripts (mostly Blender)

Since i tend to delete scripts in my slightly mad "must cleanup my HD" phases, i make this repository as a save haven for all those little experiments.

## rocky.py ##
rocky.py is a tiny script that generates some sort of rock (i guess) from random noise. Not very efficient, but it works.
